# Face Mask Detection
Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Capstone Project.

 This repository is a Capstone Project repository by Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The theme of the Capstone Project is to create a deep learning model that detects people wear a mask or not.

#### Environment

- OS : Linux
- Python 3.7.x

#### Python Packages

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pytorch
- liveloss
- sklearn

### Dataset

[Face Mask ~12K Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset)

11792 images.

### Development Setup

To run [face-mask-model.ipynb] (./face-mask-model.ipynb) you must extract the dataset in the some location and change the prefix into it in face-mask-model.ipynb
